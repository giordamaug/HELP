Welcome to HELPpy documentation!
================================

 
Essential genes are commonly defined as those required for the growth and survival of
any organism or cell. HELP stands for "Human Gene Essentiality Labelling & Prediction", a
computational framework for labelling and predicting essential genes, and HELPpy is a Python 
implementation of theHELP framework. 
Its double scope allows achieving the identification of genes through the dependency or not from
experimental data. HELPpy is a library of tools useful for the
identification of domain-specific context genes that can highlight multiple levels of
essentiality, and thus significance in the functional role of genes.

This is the Big Picture to understand the HELPpy approach.
